# Description

The basic idea behind the *RAP Generator* is to ease the life of the developer since it helps you to create most of the boiler plate coding that is needed to implement a RAP business object using the *ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP)* so that you as a developer can start more quickly to implement the business logic.  
Though there is an ADT-based generator available for SAP BTP, ABAP environment and for on premise and public cloud systems as of SAP S/4HANA 2022 this generator offers some additional features, and especially supports multiple nodes whereas the ADT-based generator only supports one table. In addition, this generator also supports SAP S/4HANA 2021.  

**RAP generates RAP**  
Technically the RAP Generator consists out of a RAP business object `ZDMO_R_RAPG_ProjectTP` that is used to generate other RAP business objects.  
The RAP Generator works similar like the well known **Key user tools** in SAP S/4HANA and uses a Fiori Elements UI. The Fiori Elements UI can be started from within ADT by opening the service binding `ZDMO_UI_RAPG_PROJECT_O4`. There you have to double-click on the entitiy *Project* which starts the Fiori Elements UI without the need to install any additional tool.     

The SAP Fiori elements preview based UI provides value helps for the data that has to be entered and it provides validations and determinations that provide the heavy lifting of specifying which table field is used for which purpose (for example, a field called *local_last_changed_at* or a field based on the data element *abp_locinst_lastchange_tstmpl* will be proposed by the RAP Generator to be used as the etag of an entity).

Once the repository objects are generated, the UI offers an ADT link that lets you conveniently navigate back into ADT to continue to work on your objects.

## What's New

- The RAP Generator uses a new UI where the basic project data is entered in the beginning, so that there is no need to use side effects.  
- The RAP Generator lets you edit the aliases for the properties of entities of your RAP business object. As a default the RAP Generator proposes aliases in CamelCase format that are derived from the underlying ABAP field names. (e.g. SalesOrder when the ABAP field is SALES_ORDER).  
- The objects that have been generated by the RAP Generator can now be safely deleted. This allows you to regenerate the repository objects in case you redo the generation in case there was a typo in the parameters that you provided.
- The generation process is visualized in a table that displays the progress of the generation or deletion alongside with detailed responses of the generation project.
- You can copy a RAP Generator project.

# Requirements

This sample code does currently work in:

- SAP BTP, ABAP environment
- SAP S/4HANA, ABAP environment
- SAP S/4HANA 2022
- SAP S/4HANA 2021

# Download and Installation

## How to Install the RAP Generator

### SAP BTP ABAP Environment and SAP S/4HANA Cloud ABAP Environment

1. Create a package **'ZDMO_RAP_GENERATOR'**.
2. Link this package with the URL of the RAP Generator repository `https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-abap-rap`.
3. Use the branch `abap-environment`.
4. Pull changes.
5. Use mass activation to activate the objects that have been imported in step 3.
6. Run the class `zdmo_cl_rap_generator_setup`. This class generates the following objects:
   - Application job catalog entries:
     - ZDMO_RAP_GEN_CATALOG_ENTRY
     - ZDMO_RAP_DEL_CATALOG_ENTRY
   - Application job templates:
     - ZDMO_RAP_GEN_JOB_TEMPLATE
     - ZDMO_RAP_DEL_JOB_TEMPLATE
   - Service binding `ZDMO_UI_RAPG_PROJECT_O4`
7. Publish the service binding `ZDMO_UI_RAPG_PROJECT_O4`.
8. Open both IAM Apps:
   -  ZDMO_RAP_DEL_CATALOG_ENTRY_SAJC: switch to the tab *Services* and choose *Publish Locally* button
   -  ZDMO_RAP_GEN_CATALOG_ENTRY_SAJC: switch to the tab *Services* and choose *Publish Locally* button

### SAP S/4HANA 2021 or 2022

1. Create a package **'TEST_DMO_RAP_GENERATOR'**.
2. Start the report `ZABAPGIT_STANDALONE`. You might have to download the [source code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abapGit/build/main/zabapgit_standalone.prog.abap) of this open source tool.
3. Create an offline repository or an online repository with the package and with the URL of the RAP Generator repo
   `https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-abap-rap`.
4. Use the branch `on-prem-2022` or `on-prem-2021`.   
5. Pull changes.
6. Use mass activation to activate the objects that have been imported in step 3.
7. Run the class `zdmo_cl_rap_generator_setup`. This class generates the following objects:
   - Application job catalog entries:
     - ZDMO_RAP_GEN_CATALOG_ENTRY
     - ZDMO_RAP_DEL_CATALOG_ENTRY
   - Application job templates:
     - ZDMO_RAP_GEN_JOB_TEMPLATE
     - ZDMO_RAP_DEL_JOB_TEMPLATE
   - Service binding `ZDMO_UI_RAPG_PROJECT_O4`(in on-premise or public cloud releases the service binding will automatically be published as well)

# Known Issues

The sample code is provided "as-is".

## all on premise branches

- There is an issue when adding a new entity. You will receive an **No Value for Entity tag found** error.  When refreshing the object page you will however see that the new entry in the list of entities have been added.  The issue is currently being investigated.   

## SAP BTP, ABAP Environment

- The application job that has to be used to generate the repository object cannot be started immediately in SAP BTP, ABAP environment. Instead we have to wait for the background job scheduler to start the job, which can take up to one minute. This is behavior will be fixed in a future release once an proper background processing framework becomes available.

## on_premise_2021

- When using the RAP Generator in on-premise systems, you have to make sure that the latest SAPUI5 libraries are installed. If you donâ€™t have the latest version of the SAPUI5 libraries installed you will get no dialogue when choosing the **New Project** button in the RAP Generator.
If the latest SAPUI5 libraries cannot be installed, you can use an implicit enhancement in method `get_sapui5core_resources_url( )` of class `CL_ADT_ODATAV2_FEAP` as described in the following [blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/04/16/how-to-use-the-latest-sapui5-library-for-the-fiori-elements-preview-in-adt/).
